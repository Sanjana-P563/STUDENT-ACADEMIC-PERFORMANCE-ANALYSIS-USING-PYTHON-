# STUDENT-ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS-USING-PYTHON
# Analyzed a large student performance dataset (6,600+ records, 20 variables) using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to identify key factors influencing exam scores.
# Performed data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, replacing categorical variables, and preparing data for analysis.
# Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations such as heatmaps, scatter plots, box plots, violin plots, histograms, and bar charts to uncover trends and correlations.
# Derived actionable insights showing the impact of study hours, attendance, motivation, teacher quality, and socio-economic factors on academic performance, supporting data-driven educational decisions.
